üëçüéâ First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! üéâüëç

### How to Contribute

The easiest way to get started is to file an issue to tell us about a spelling
mistake, some awkward wording, or a factual error. This is a good way to
introduce yourself and to meet some of our community members.

1. If you have a [GitHub][github] account, or are willing to [create
   one][github-join], but do not know how to use Git, 
   you can open an issue (bug report, feature request, or something is not working)
   https://github.com/LearnToDiscover/Case_Studies_L2D/issues/new/choose
   This allows us to assign the item to someone and to respond to it in a threaded discussion.

2. If you are comfortable with Git, and would like to add or change material,
   you can submit a pull request (PR). Instructions for doing this are
   [included below](#using-github).
